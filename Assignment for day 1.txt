
1.Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript)

    JavaScript is a text-based programming language used in both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.
    Where the Html and css are languages that give structure and style to web pages,javascript give the interactive elements that engage a user.

2.What is the difference between client-side and server-side?
    Client-side -> Its mean's that the processing takes place on the user's computer.
                   It requires browsers to run the script on the client machine without involving any processing on the server.

    Server-side -> It's mean's that the processing takes place on a web server. 

3.What is Nodejs?
    * Nodejs is a open-source,cross-platform,back-end javascript runtime environment.
    * Nodejs runs on the V8 engine and executes javascript code outside a web browser.

4.Explain Scope in JavaScript?
    
    The javascript Scope are divide into 3 types are:
       - Block scope
       - Function scope
       - Global scope
   Scope determines the accessibility(visibility) of varibles.

 ->Block Scope :
     - The block scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block,form access by the outside of the block.
     - Let and const are the keywords in the javascript block scope
        
       Let keywords
     {
       let amount = 0;
     }

       const keywords
     {
        const pi = 3.14;
     }
     - variables declared with the var keyword can not have block scope.
     - Variables declared inside a {} block can be accessed form outside the block.
 ->Function Scope :
    -Each function creates a new scope.
    -Variables defined inside a function are not accessible(visible)from outside the function.
    -Variables declared with var,let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.
       
        Var keyword
      function myfunction() {
            var name = "Rama";
       }

        Let keyword
      function myfunction() {
            let name = "Rama";
      }
   
        Const keyword
     function myfunction() {
            const name = "Rama";
      }
  ->Global Scope :
     -Variables declared globally (outside any function) have global scope.
     -Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a javascript program.
     -Variables declared with var,let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

    const number = 123;
    function myfunction() {
          document.getElementById('demo").innerHTML = number;
   }

7.Explain DOM in your own word?
    - The DOM is a W3C (World wide web consortium) standard.
    - The W3C Document object model(DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the             content,structure,and style of a document.
    - The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
        * Core DOM -standard model for all document types
        * XML DOM  -standard model for HTML documents
        * HTML DOM -standard model for HTML documents

5.JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous?

     - Javascript is both asynchronous and synchronous,since using promises javascript is a asynchronous.

6.JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded?

     -Javascript is single-threaded.
     -It has one call stack and one memory heap.as expected,it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next.
